We can pass props from a parent component to a child component.

Why would we do this?

We can make components more reusable. More dynamic.
If we have multiple data that is the same. We have only define that data in one sigle place!

For example if we use user Data multiple times in out App
We can just define it only one time in our parent coponent and pass it with props on to the child components

We can pass a tag that we definined into multiple components if we define it first on global

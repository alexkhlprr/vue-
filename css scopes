So we learnded that we have our html three

Css scopes works as in divs

verything that we define in our parent id will be handelt to the child components

if you define css in parent componets it it all the handelt to the other unless you use the scoped variable in the style tag

so in components always use scoped


you can also make a global style and import it into your main.js file
